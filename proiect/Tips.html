                <h3>Establish a working plan!</h3>
                <dd>The plan should include all phases of work on the thesis, from searching for a topic to submitting your work.
                    <ul>
                        <li> Do not think too detailed</li>
                        <li>Fix clear deadlines</li>

                <h3>Use apps!</h3>
                <dd><a href="https://trello.com" target=_blank>Trello</a> is a project management tool (available as a smartphone app) which allows you to create ‘boards’
                    on which to pin all of your outstanding tasks, deadlines, and ideas.
                    It allows you to make checklists too so you know that all of your important stuff
                    is listed and to-hand, meaning you can focus on one thing at a time. It’s satisfying to move notes into
                    the <strong>done</strong> column too.</dd>

                    <h3> Address the unanswered questions!</h3>
                    <dd>There will always be unanswered questions – don’t try to ignore or, even worse, obfuscate them.
                        On the contrary, actively draw attention to them; identify them in your conclusion as areas for further investigation.</dd>

                        <h3>Get feedback on the whole thesis!</h3>
                        <dd>We often get feedback on individual chapters but plan to get feedback from your supervisor to make sure it all hangs together nicely.</dd>
